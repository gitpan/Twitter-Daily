To Do list
----------

- Pass string like 'today' and 'yesterday' into --date  (this is very useful
  to avoid making scripting to change every day the --date parameter)
- Use non repeating names for twitter published files like adding the date 
  and the time, to avoid deletion of older entries
- Check if it works fine with older dates
